# Image-Queries
Image Queries is a Computer Vision project implemented through a video search method to retrieve relevant frames from a video based on features in a query region selected from some frame. A dataset of size 6GB was used to experiment with the algorithm outcomes.
The dataset is not added to this particular repo, if needed, please contact me at <yunnizhu@gatech.edu>.
